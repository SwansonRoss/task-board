# Project Overview

We wanted to create a simple website where activists can post things they need or tasks they need completed, so other activists in their area can claim those tasks and help out.

# What needs to be done?

Most of it.  
There are some todo's mostly related to actually doing anything meaningful with the data.

- Create users
- Create separate instances for different regions (Don't want to weed through posts from all over, if you're only interested in Chicago)
- Really anything you want!
